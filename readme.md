# Recharts-Jest
### Background
I originally made this repo just to solve a build issue with Recharts. An Enzyme test was failing, so I went about fixing it.
The test was checking an outdated area in the library, so I wanted to replace it with a Jest test.
So now we have what we have today.
It didn't feel right to  so I tried making some more Enzyme tests 

I hope to add more to this when I have time. Until then, it'd anyone who can contribute would help out a lot.

By modernizing the testing framework, we can make Recharts easier to use.
