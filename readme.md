# Recharts Jest

The intention of this project is to eventually provide jest tests to the recharts library.

The motivation behind this project is because there are several tests in the project using older libraries such as Enzyme to perform tests on the project.

By modernizing the testing framework, the development base could more effectively test different parts of the library consistently.
